# Postmortem

```"Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not."```
