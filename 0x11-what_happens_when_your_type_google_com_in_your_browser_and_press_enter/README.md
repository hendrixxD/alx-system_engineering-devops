This question is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position. It is used to assess a candidateâ€™s general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that you should ask your interviewer whether they would like you to focus in on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position they may want you to talk at length about how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position they may want you to go into the load balancing mechanism.

This question is a good test of whether you understand DNS. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, so if you do well on this question, you are already way ahead of the curve. If you take this project seriously and write an excellent article, it may be something that will grab the attention of future employers.

I wrote a block post that covers what happens https://www.google.com and enter key is pressed.
the block post covers the the following:

    DNS request
    TCP/IP
    Firewall
    HTTPS/SSL
    Load-balancer
    Web server
    Application server
    Database
Also a schema explainig the blog post, it contains diagrams on;

    DNS resolution
    that the request hitting server IP on the appropriate port
    that the traffic is encrypted
    that the traffic goes through a firewall
    that the request is distributed via a load balancer
    that the web server answers the request by serving a web page
    that the application server generates the web page
    that the application server request data from the database

Also a contribution to the answer comprehensively.. i am submiting a pull request.
