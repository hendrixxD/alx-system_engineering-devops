Issues With This Infrastructure: 

SPOF:
single point of failure is an integral part of
any running system and so, if it fails, the entire system crashes.
this is an undesirable effect for high achieving organisations as it
breaks the goal of high availabilty and reliability.

Downtime:
deploying new updates generally is a thedious task and engaging activity.
and so, servers are restarted and if no proper notice is issued to clients
or provisions arent met to accomodate the next 24hrs usuallly, clients may lose data and info.

Traffic:
assuming there was a massive and overwhelming traffic
the lone server wont contain the load of requests it has
to process, and so its optimal speed decreases or even crashes.
